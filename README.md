# LLM-Prompting-for-CXL-Simulator

**Extending architectural simulators for emerging memory technologies using Large Language Models (LLMs)**

---

## Project Overview

This research explores the feasibility of using Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude) to extend the VANS (Validated cycle-Accurate NVRAM Simulator) with support for CXL (Compute Express Link) memory simulation. Instead of manual coding, we apply advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate simulator code automatically.

**Goal:** Build a CXL-capable simulator by leveraging LLMs to extend existing architectural simulators without starting from scratch.

## Key Research Questions

- Can LLMs effectively extend complex architectural simulators?  
- Which prompting strategies best support systems-level code generation?  
- What are the capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted simulator development?  
- How does LLM-generated code compare with traditional development methods?

## Architecture

- **Base Simulator:** VANS ‚Äî a cycle-accurate event-driven simulator for Optane DIMM microarchitecture  
- **Target Extension:** CXL memory device and system integration  
- **LLMs Used:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-3.5/4 Turbo for automated code generation

### Core Components Generated

src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cxl_memory.cpp/h - CXL Type 3 memory device model with protocol-level latency
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cxl_system.cpp/h - Memory controller and request routing management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ factory.cpp - Extended component factory for CXL registration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vans.cpp - Modified integration layer with CXL support
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cxl_config.cfg - CXL-specific configuration parameters

### System Integration

The CXL extension integrates with VANS through:  

- **Modular Architecture:** Maintains VANS component structure  
- **Factory Pattern:** Enables configurable CXL memory instantiation  
- **Event-Driven Model:** Preserves cycle-accurate simulation timing  
- **Memory Hierarchy:** Supports local DRAM + CXL memory configurations

## Experimental Methodology

To design effective prompts for building CXL-VANS, ideas from [4], [5], and [6] were referenced. Various prompting techniques were experimented with, described below:

### 3.1 Zero Shot Prompting

- Uses a single prompt with all details.  
- Relies on LLM‚Äôs retrieval-augmented generation capabilities.  
- Lacks deeper context for complex tasks.

### 3.2 Role-based Prompting

- Assigns a specific role to the LLM (e.g., system architect).  
- Provides detailed file structure and architecture context.  
- Effective for complex coding and system-level reasoning.  

### 3.3 Few-shot Learning

- Supplies example code snippets as references.  
- Helps with pattern-based or repetitive code generation.  
- Performance depends on example quality, less adaptable to new methods.

### 3.4 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

- Breaks complex tasks into step-by-step reasoning.  
- Produces organized solutions but may diverge from original structure.

### 3.5 Iterative Refinement Prompting

- Multiple rounds of interaction and code refinement.  
- Effective for debugging and improving code quality over iterations.

## Results Summary

### LLM Efficiency

- Average Token Consumption: ~1000 tokens per session  
- Generation Time: Seconds to minutes per iteration  
- Refinement Cycles: Typically 2-3 for production-ready code  
- Success Rate: Varies by prompting technique
